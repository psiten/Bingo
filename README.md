# Bingo
Instantiate a database linked to a local html display to run a customizable bingo game

# About

This project is purely in its nascent stages, but is being created with the goal of running 
a gameshow-style presentation at a convention or party gathering. The initial sample database
will produce a "standard" bingo game using numbers between 1 and 100, but later release 
packages may contain other kinds of novelty bingo sets, and the database will be customizable 
for your own needs.

# End Product

When complete, this code should allow you to:

1) Produce randomized bingo cards from the chosen database. You will have the option to enable 
or disable "Columns by Category" and the "Free Space".

2) Using any computer with the correct database software installed, display a browser-based 
presentation that randomly draws selections from the database and dynamically displays them to 
the audience.

3) During a presentation, generate a checkfile that will allow you to verify whether a 
competitor has checked off selections that have actually been called.

Any additional activities you wish to include with your Bingo Game, such as prizes, guessing 
games, or creativity games, are entirely up to you.
